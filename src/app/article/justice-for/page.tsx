      <h2>When the inequalities that women face in Ethiopia have a face.</h2>

          She stood in a field of meskel flowers, her coffee coils plaited back
          into five tight braids. Her red and sky blue uniform was stained and
          she smelled of eucalyptus and the horses that had dragged her. Under
          her long lashes were the pools of the Danakil Depression, and as she
          grasped the shotgun with her life, she had the blood of her abductor
          on her hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          This fictional character, Hirut Assefa from the Ethiopian movie
          Difret, was 14 when she was abducted and raped, but so was Aberash
          Bekele, from whom the story was derived. Aberash Bekele was 14, at the
          time a 29-year-old farmer came to abduct her. He and his friends
          abducted her as part of an Ethiopian ritual named Tefela, otherwise
          known as the abduction of child brides. Her soon-to-be-husband beat
          and raped her, and left her to rot like an injured animal, with the
          vultures threatened to come back at any minute. Aberash managed to
          escape shortly after, but when she ran away she faced a confrontation
          with the 29-year-old farmer, which forced Aberash to shoot him in self
          defense. Countless court cases ensued, in which the Ethiopian's Woman
          Lawyers Association(EWLA) tried to get the girl out of the death
          penalty her village promised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of Aberash depicted in Defrit is one of the few public media
          that features the gender inequality that women are forced to endure in
          Ethiopia everyday. These types of stories often fail to come to light
          and reach juridical attention. Among the few examples of gender
          inequality made public in Ethiopia are prominent cases such as Hanna
          Langlanos' story; a story about a young girl who was gang raped for
          ten days and left for dead (Wegayehu). The fact that these stories are
          not often discussed or heard about, does not mean they do not exist in
          Ethiopia. On the other hand, girls like Belaynesh, Meskerem, Aberash,
          Hannah and countless others have been made to face the inequalities
          that society had reserved for them. Unfortunately these, are tales for
          the neighbours to whisper and the winds to carry, as any talk of
          female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage and sexual violence
          are often hushed. These infractions on women's rights in Ethiopia have
          become deeply enmeshed in their standards and culture, often promoted
          as 'tradition' and 'religious belief', thus normalizing FGM, child
          marriage and sexual violence.

        <h3>#JusticeforBelainesh</h3>
        <p>
          While rituals like Tefela in the movie difret are now scarce and laws
          have been put in place prohibiting child marriage, the issue has not
          ceased to exist. Mr. Eshetu, child protection specialist at World
          Vision, explained that child marriage is still a problem. The ritual
          surrounding child marriage is something that communities have
          struggled to give up as “different areas have been practicing child
          marriage for ages- for centuries”(Eshetu). Mr. Eshetu continued to
          explain that child marriage “has been transmitted through generations
          without knowing its bad consequences”, which makes it hard for
          communities to give up the practice. In his fight against child
          marriage Mr. Eshetu carried the lost voice of Belainesh, by telling
          her story.
        </p>
        <h2>
          “different areas have been practicing child marriage for ages- for
          centuries”
        </h2>
        <p>
          Belainesh's bare calloused feet would slap onto the 3km dust road to
          school, leaving a cloud behind each one of her soles. She arrived in
          her crowded eight grade classroom where the walls were chipped and the
          wood of the desks was rotting. Yet even stuck like a sardine between
          two girls a smile evaded her small lips as the teacher asked them to
          open their books in preparation for the national exams. After school
          one day, she walked home the same trail as usual, hanging onto her
          books like her life depended on it. The Ethiopian sun pounded on her
          back, and droplets of sweat escaped where her hair and forehead met.
          She listened to the wind tickle the bushes, when she heard the heavy
          footsteps approach her. As they came out of the shadows, she realised
          they were four. They surrounded her and took her with them. The
          minutes of desperation faded into hours, and before she knew it they
          had brought her to an unknown village. She didn't recognise the
          houses, the kids playing soccer, or even the cattles grazing. Only the
          blazing sun and open blue sky felt familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next moments that Mr. Eshetu described were a haze. He explained
          that the girl was kept with her future husband [most likely raped],
          and then taken to see the elderly. They contacted the girls family to
          plan the wedding. She had nothing left; her virginity was gone. The
          parents had no option but to agree and give away their daughter and
          her future. She lived with the man responsible for her abduction, and
          rape, until she couldn't stand it anymore, and escaped. She is now
          pursuing her education and taking care of her son; left with the scars
          of her past but with the promise of a future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Eshetu talked about some of the physical, mental, social and
          economical consequences that the young girls like Belainesh are forced
          to face. The physical ones being the most concerning. After child
          marriage “some get pregnant imediatly and because their body is not
          mature enough to cary baby there are complications during birth”
          (Eshetu). Most girls that get pregnant at such a young age have to
          face fistula. Fistula is an abnormal connection between organs that
          can cause infection and even death.{" "}
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>#JusticeforBogaletch</h3>
        <p>
          Fistula is commonly known to be caused by premature pregnancies, but
          also as a result of female genital mutilation. Female genital
          mutilation is another prevalent issue that women in Ethiopia have to
          face. Nearly 65.2% of women in Ethiopia aged 15-49 have experienced
          FGM (28 Too Many). These numbers reach all the way up to around 90% of
          women aged 15-49 in regions like Afar and Somali.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Afar, Somali and most other regions the most common form of FGM
          consists of cutting, removing or inflicting other harm to a part of a
          woman's genital organs for non-medical reasons. This makes FGM a
          violation against a women's rights as according to the UN Article 16
          all citizens are protected against bodily harm (Pathfinder). The
          people and families of FGM victims partaking in the ritual could be
          charged, but lack of follow up in Ethiopia stops that from happening.
          The lack of enforcement of the law is not the only problem, but the
          fact that the rituals are often held at night by the families and away
          from hospitals makes it hard for officials to trace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stories of FGM often only end up coming to light when girls are
          lost to the practice. In September for example, two Somali sisters
          bled to death after their circumcision.The girls were 10 and 11. The
          girls happened to be found as a result of their death, but often girls
          go through these procedures without anyone knowing. This is one of the
          few cases that has been shared about FGM in Ethiopia, but that doesn't
          mean that families don't continue to participate in the ritual. In
          addition, even deaths often go unreported as families are scared of
          the shame that this would bring, especially as it regards such a
          touchy subject as FGM.
        </p>
        <p>
          FGM is one of the many harmful practices in Ethiopia that communities
          are having trouble reliquishing. Dr. Saba Lambert, a gynecologist and
          doctor working at the general hospital of Addis Ababa, faces FGM
          survivors everyday in her line of work. In the interview Dr. Lambert
          talked about the close ties that FGM has with the coming of age. In
          many communities “there is this whole belief that you are not a woman
          until that is done”(Lambert). Many of them believe that it represents
          breaching the line between girlhood and womanhood through the same
          methods as their ancestors. FGM being a huge symbol for coming of age,
          makes it extremely hard to give up as it has become a tradition
          embedded in the Ethiopian communities. That would explain why so many
          mothers make their daughters sit through this procedure, when they
          have experienced the pain themselves. Women are not the only ones that
          play a part in bringing this twisted ritual to life, in fact men and
          village elderly play a huge role as well. In certain regions of
          Ethiopia, especially the Afar and Somali region, “Men often think that
          if she has not been done then she wouldn't be a good wife” (Lambert).
          In rural areas, where education is scarce for women, the main priority
          remains to get married. Marriage is often seen as a sign of success.
          This means that many women have to go through FGM just so that they
          can then form their own families and survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bogaletch Gebre was a mere girl when she was forced to undergo the
          torurous ritual of FGM as a rite of passage in her village, in
          Ethiopia's Kembetta zone, called “cleansing the dirt”. That night her
          mother, who was helping with the procedures, had been agonizing over
          her child's faith; she didn't want to hurt Bogaletch, but she felt as
          though she had no choice as her beliefs, and religion demanded it
          (Yee). After her cutting at the age of 12 Bogaletch had to spend 2
          months recovering from the cutting (Green). In those months Bogaletch
          endured excessive bleeding and severe pain. Bogaletch escaped death by
          a hair. On the other hand her sister wasn't so lucky; she died of the
          complications of FGM at child birth. After the ritual her father
          refused to let her go back to school. But Bogaletch's story is not a
          sad one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bogaletch did not take no as an answer. When her father refused to
          send her to school, she decided to attend an informal one, with the
          help of a progressive uncle. This allowed her to later on join a
          missionary school and attend Addis Ababa university as one of the
          first girls. After studying at Addis Ababa university, she finally
          attended university in Israel where she studied science. Even with her
          higher education in Epidemiology, she came back to Ethiopia to help
          the young girls who so desperately needed the voice she lacked at
          their age. She and her sister are now credited for virtually
          eliminating FGM in the Kembatta region, where the population is nearly
          680,000.

        <p>
          FGM and child marriage are not the only indignities weighing on a
          woman's conciousness, instead sexual violence is just as common place.
          In the same visit to Dr. Lambert last week, she solemnly shared a
          story of a young girl who came into her bright white office at the
          government hospital of Addis Ababa a few years ago. The room smelled
          of disinfectant and bleach, when the girl walked in, clutched to her
          mother's arm. They had come seeking medical advice for her daughter
          who had been raped. The girl lived in a compound, where the yard was
          shared and the neighbors socialized. One of the neighbours had taken
          interest in the girl and tried to lure her into his home. The sweets,
          chocolates and pleasantries of the man's company rubbed off on the
          girl, and he finally managed to lure her inside. Once inside the man
          forced himself upon her and raped her. He told the girl that if she
          dared let her little tongue run, he would kill her and her mother. The
          girl had the courage to come forward and tell her mother, who worked
          as a guard at the government hospital. She was only seven at the time.
        </p>
        <h2>
          “It's [usually] their father, brother, uncles, teachers, or a
          neighbour,”
        </h2>
        <p>
          Just like the seven year old girl, it is common for women in Ethiopia
          to be assaulted by the people closest to them. As a matter of fact
          “it's very rare that a stranger rapes a woman”(Alejandro). “It's
          [usually] their father, brother, uncles, teachers, or a neighbour,”
          Mr. Alejandro, an active member of a women's organisation called
          Setaweet, explained. So even in the most safe environments like school
          or home, girls can never truly let their guard down. In the university
          of Wolaita Sodo, in Ethiopia. 45.4% of students confirmed that they
          experienced some type of sexual violence in their life time, and 36.1%
          said they experienced it since attending the university (Adinew and
          Hagos). Considering that universities are closed and controlled
          spaces, the fact that sexual violence continues to happen, exemplifies
          that it is done by the people that surround the vitims on a day to day
          basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hearing the story, Dr. Lambert cofessed “for me the mother was
          the most traumatic case as the mother refused for us to go forward”.
          The mother, Dr. Lambert said, was scared that her daughter would be
          “judged forever as the little girl that was raped”, and while she did
          not want to harm the girl's reputation Dr. Lambert believed that he
          should be stopped because “there must be other kids in that
          neighborhood who he must be doing this to”. Yet the mother held her
          head high and refused to budge; afraid of the judgement of others and
          the possibility of her daughter going unmarried, when the word came
          out that her daughter was no longer a virgin.
        </p>
        <h2>
          “there must be other kids in that neighborhood who he must be doing
          this to”
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is through this type of occasional story that the reality of sexual
          violence comes to light in Ethiopia. Especially because the taboo
          surrounding these types of issues prevents the needed awareness. Often
          this is because women become the culprits in this situation, or are
          frowned upon by society. Mr. Alejandro explained that when stories
          like these are told people start to ask questions like “where were
          you? What were you doing? Were you drinking? (. . . ) and they ask
          about her sexul background,”. This takes the light away from the
          harasser and makes the women feel guilty for what happened to her.
          Then there is the idea that a woman is “beneath the man,” socially,
          according to religion and culture (Alejandro).
        </p>
        <p>
          The taboo of talking about such cases and bringing these to light is
          what organisations like the Ethiopian Women's Lawyers Association
          (EWLA) and Setaweet are trying to tackle. They have dealt with
          countless cases, one of the most famous ones being Aberash Bekeles
          child marriage and rape case. EWLA first started when Ethiopia was
          finally opening up to democracy, after the bloody Derg regime. Through
          policy making, authentic citizen engagement, evidence based advocacy,
          and arming women with the information they needed to combat the
          patriarchal landscapes of Ethiopia, EWLA managed to transform the
          lives of so many women. EWLA has also managed to participate in the
          implementation of different laws, inlcuding one on child marriage
          (Woldeyes and Earuyan Solutions).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my investigation, I tried to reach out to EWLA to talk about their
          progress and work over the years. Their phone number on facebook
          didn't seem to be working because every time I called I wouldn't get
          an answer. I was slowly starting to lose hope, when suddenly in an
          interview with Mr. Alejandro from setaweet, he mentioned that he had
          the EWLA's directors phone number. I initially thought that with this
          information, I would be able to get a hold of the organisation that
          seemed to abscond me. I called him every day for a week, but got the
          same answer every time; “This person is currently unavailable please
          redial later”. It was like the phone didn't belong to the director at
          all, but instead to the Ethiotelecom correspondent. Me and a
          classmate, working on a similar investigation, decided to take the
          matter into our own hands. We looked up the location of EWLA and drove
          all the way over there in hope that we could at least set an
          appointment for one day. We arrived, and where the office of EWLA was
          supposed to stand, there was a construction sight of a seven story
          building. We asked around, wondering if maybe EWLA had moved to a new
          location, but nobody seemed to know. We finally entered a small
          clothing store that smelled of smoke and mens perfume, and they
          directed us towards a building in front of millennial hall. We drove
          there with our fingers crossed, hoping that this was the real
          location. What we encountered there was a tall apartment building with
          no signs of the EWLA office. We walked in and a humid moldy smell hung
          in the air. On the second floor there was a dark hallway, and at the
          end of it stood a board with “the Ethiopian Women's federation”. There
          were no signs of life on the other side of the door. That left me to
          wonder; How do girls reach them? Is it for privacy or is there
          something else going on?
