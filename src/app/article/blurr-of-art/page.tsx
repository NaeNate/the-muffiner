          In this incredible art piece, we see eloquent strokes synthesized with
          bold colors which conveys a desolate, melancholic, and almost
          distressing atmosphere. We are also introduced to a van gogh inspired
          theme which all the more adds to the created tension. At first glance,
          The giant house, being one of the most salient features of this piece
          stood out to me. There is almost a chapel-like element to it, as the
          windows possess their own unique pattern. Additionally, the dark blue
          color of the sky fused with the black detailing also entails a more
          sinister backstory. -What could be happening?
          <br />
          <br />I feel as though the woman in the body of art represents a
          fragmented piece of a larger story. She is the ideal symbol of a
          person living in a towering and dark world. Much like the darkness, we
          are clouded within the real world, examples being covid, systemic
          racism, and other global issuesâ€¦ Us as humans are just tiny beings
          compared to the actual issue. Additionally, I also believe that us
          humans have the ability to make decisions, which in the art is
          illustrated through the 2 different paths.--And although we are
          unaware of what lies ahead, we still confide in choosing a certain
          route. Lastly, I think the blurred effect from the pastels induces the
          narrative that there might not necessarily be a binary solution to the
          problems that we are facing today. But alternatively lead us humans to
          a never ending cycle of confusion and blur.
