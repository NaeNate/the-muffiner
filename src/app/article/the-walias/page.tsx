          “Adane! Saladin! Adane! Seladiiiin… Goooal!!” announced the elated
          football commentator. Everyone was cheering, some were crying in joy,
          and some were daydreaming of the promised land the national team was
          headed to. Ethiopia 2, Sudan 0. If the game concludes with this
          result, Ethiopians could start thinking about buying flight tickets to
          South Africa to support their national team in the upcoming African
          Cup of Nations. And so it was. After 31 years of waiting, the
          Ethiopian national team was to participate in the African Cup of
          Nations. But alas! The team could not make its way past the group
          stage.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ethiopia is known for several things. Its ancient civilization,
          coffee, athletic runners, and, maybe, its good-looking women. However,
          it is hard to say that the nickname “the Walias” or “the Ethiopian
          Football National Team” rings one’s bell who is not really into
          Ethiopian Football. One might even ask, “Does Ethiopia even have an
          active national football team?” A quite reasonable question to ask.
          But what to say?
          <br />
          <br />
          The Ethiopian national team is a team with an intricate history that
          is worth looking at. Every single page features a new challenge, a new
          team, and a whole different picture. With an ever-changing style of
          football, the Walias with respect to other national teams seemed to be
          frozen in their progress. Ever since their golden age, their
          reputation eroded until nothing but the rubble of its once revered,
          grand history remained. However, this did not come about because
          Ethiopians suddenly stopped football or because the players were
          rendered unskilled. It is because of some underlying factors to be
          examined. But first, it is important to put things into perspective
          before we continue on. Let’s head back to the golden age of Ethiopian
          football, the 1950s, and 1960s.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ethiopia has a long football tradition and was once amongst the most
          accomplished football teams in all of Africa. What’s more, Ethiopia
          was one of the four countries that established what is today known as
          the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Ethiopia qualified for
          regional and continental competitions again and again, to the extent
          that it became nothing other than normal. The team had high set
          expectations, just like big clubs such as FC Barcelona and Real Madrid
          have today, always ending up in the top three by the end of every
          season.
          <br />
          <br />
          The trophy room of the national team is also not empty. In fact, the
          national team has multiple precious wins and achievements under its
          belt. The team was a one-time champion of the African Cup of Nations,
          four-time champions of the Council of East and Central Africa Football
          Association (CECAFA) cup, and many more occasions in which it was able
          to finish on the podium. This was a success that many could not hope
          for during that time.
          <br />
          <br />
          That team was undoubtedly “accomplished and successful” (Dr. Elias),
          especially in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The team made seven
          consecutive appearances in the African Cup of Nations. However,
          somehow, something has hindered back the progress of the Walias since
          their golden age. Dr. Elias Abi, professional physical fitness coach
          and head of Decathlon Fitness Evaluation Laboratory remarked, “Our
          biggest problem is that we could not walk along with the ever-changing
          football.”
          <br />
          <br />
          That team was undoubtedly accomplished and successful, especially in
          the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The team managed to qualify for seven
          consecutive African Cup of Nations. However, that is no longer the
          case with the national team. As years ticked by, its appearances in
          international competitions became inconsistent. Just like a light bulb
          flickering on and off, suffering from an ailment, or maybe, the
          voltage is too high it can not handle it any better. Football has
          become more vigorous and has evolved over the years. But what about
          the Walias? Dr. Elias Abi, professional physical fitness coach and
          head of Decathlon Fitness Evaluation Laboratory remarked, “Our biggest
          problem is that we could not walk along with the ever-changing
          football.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Yes, that is the problem in a nutshell. Football moves forward,
          constantly changing in style, but the national team could not adapt
          well enough. There is no one entity or factor which could be held
          accountable. The truth is as Mesud Muhammed, a player in the Ethiopian
          national team said, “If we are going to point at someone to blame,
          everyone shall pick their share.” (Mesud)
          <br />
          <br />
          Tracking down who to blame can be a cumbersome task and a long
          journey. Nonetheless,
          <br />
          <br />
          Ever since the 1960s, the team has been plagued by myriad issues that
          led to this point and it might be a daunting task to come up with a
          complete who-to-blame list. However, I think the Ethiopian premier
          league and the participating clubs make a good starting point. As a
          matter of fact, the national league is lacking in many aspects, such
          as organization, and the clubs that take part have numerous issues
          such as lack of “professional knowledge and facilities” (Dr. Abi), …
          Edilu Derege, a former national team player and a current manager of
          Debre Birhan Kenema (a football club) mentioned, “It is possible to
          build a good national team through having a good competition amongst
          clubs, and in this regard, I think we did a poor job.”
          <br />
          <br />
          One direct implication of this is that the national team is faced with
          the challenge of picking high-caliber players; physically fit,
          tactically aware, and skilled. At the same time coming up with a
          complete set of such players seems impractical. Recalling the point
          which was made earlier, it might be possible that Ethiopian players
          nowadays could pass for the kind of football where “the average
          distance a player covers in a game was around 7 km.” (Dr. Abi) back in
          the day. But now, things have changed remarkably. The average distance
          has risen to around 11.5 km (site). But here is where the main
          question arises, “Why couldn’t the Walias adapt while many others
          did?” Apparently, the clubs themselves have failed to keep up with the
          evolving football.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ethiopian Football has highly underestimated the importance of
          physical fitness. Starting from premier league clubs up to the
          national team, players are not as fit as they should be if they are to
          play for a win. “In Europe, kids around the age of 14 in football
          academies have the endurance to run 17 km per hour. I have conducted
          the same test for the players in the main national team and only five
          of them seem to compare with the kids.” (Dr. Abi) At first, this might
          seem like an exaggeration, but in reality, this statement proves
          itself true. In Ethiopia, the distance the best midfielders can
          effectively cover in a game is 15 km while in Europe, players in the
          same position cover a distance over 22 km.
          <br />
          <br />
          The national team is the culmination of this problem, not where its
          starts. “In this country, the club organization is very shameful,”
          said Dr. Elias. “There isn’t any football club in Ethiopia, even the
          big clubs, which has a fitness expert”. This shows that the problem is
          far-reaching, and that building a high-caliber national team is
          basically to “build up from scratch.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Another major problem is that Ethiopian football heavily relies on
          government funding. Although the government should stand by the side
          of the national team, the fact that most clubs can not function
          without the support of the government creates the skepticism that
          clubs are not working as hard as they should. “As Dr. Abiy said, if
          the government were to pull its hands out of Ethiopian Football, there
          wouldn’t be a team which could have stood by its own, save for St.
          Georgis,” said Dr. Elieas, “and the committee who are chosen are
          always routing the money to their own personal benefits”.
          <br />
          <br />
          Still, this is not the last problem. Inconveniences seem to cascade
          downwards to even the youth. As a general rule of thumb, the youth are
          critical to ensure a bright future if they are taken care of properly.
          Kylian Mbappe was only 19 when he won the World cup. The same applies
          to other sports as well. “Tirunesh Dibaba [an Ethiopian athlete] was
          only 18 when she competed [and won] in Paris [2003 World Championship
          for Athletics.] . . . If FIFA did not have the U-17 and U-20 teams as
          a requirement for the recognition of a team, no one would have
          bothered. They don’t even feed them properly. You can not project the
          future when you don’t look at your kids.” (Dr. Abi)
          <br />
          <br />
          Ethiopia does not have a well-established system to support the youth,
          as a result, the national team has not been able to be built up by
          quality players for several years. According to Aneleve, one major
          reason for the lack of progress in the Ethiopian national team is that
          there is no well-organized youth academy in the country. As this piles
          up, it creates further obstacles for the national team to deal with.
          Describing this issue, Dereje noted, “They do not grow learning
          tactics,” and this results in a less experienced team.
          <br />
          <br />
          A major problem that arises when talking about the youth is the lack
          of the necessary infrastructure and system to help the youth foster a
          strong connection with football at a fundamental level. Usually, the
          road map to becoming a professional footballer does not start off with
          joining a youth soccer academy or jumping straight into a club, but
          rather it was by becoming a star on a known field around your
          surrounding. Back in the old days, there was a “lot of them” (Mesud).
          Even though they were not of high standards, they were still many
          things. Kids could spend their time playing, and if some were too
          serious about it, those playing fields gave them the chance to pursue
          their passion and consequently, no more worrying over the next
          generation.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, things have changed for the worse in recent years. Those
          fields which were once centers for sport fans and passionate youth
          players are now replaced by buildings. “In my opinion, the two main
          things which led to the long term downfall of the national team are
          the poor work on the youth and the lack of infrastructures with
          regards to football” (Dereje)
          <br />
          <br />
          I can tell this from a personal experience. Like any other kid in my
          surrounding, I used to go and play football with my friends on a
          grassy soccer field. The ground was more or less even and did not
          present any big challenges during our games. Days passed, then months,
          then a day came when it was cultivated to grow crops.
          <br />
          <br />
          All it takes is perseverance. Every national team has its downtimes
          and the Walia’s are no exception. It might have seemed long looming
          darkness, but changes need to happen if anything good is to be
          expected. Besides, the future sometimes bears the unthinkable.
          <br />
          <br />
          After mentioning all the points above, that does not mean the Walias
          are out of hope. In fact, the national team is a win and a draw away
          from qualifying one more time for the African Cup of Nations 2021. Two
          games await the Walias, one against Madascar here in Ethiopia and
          another away match against Cote d’Ivoire (SoccerWay). Mesud stated,
          “Everyone [in the team] has the motivation and we are sure that we can
          be seen in international competitions once again.” So, if you are ever
          planning on dropping Ethiopia make sure to support the team. Plus,
          there are also insane rivalries and derbies between premier league
          clubs you would definitely want to check out. They really are worth
          your time and they will certainly make quite an experience for you in
          your time here in Ethiopia.
